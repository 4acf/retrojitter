# RetroJitter
A simple After Effects plugin which aims to recreate the jittering of old displays.
Requires the After Effects SDK to compile.
To use the plugin, download and place into `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Plug-ins`.
 
This was built with the intention of being used on low res footage at low framerates, but it works on any resolution and framerate.
Color bit depth higher than 8 and applying the effect directly to images is currently NOT supported. It will be in the future.
